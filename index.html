<h3>Photogrammatron</h3> 
<p>Photogrammatron is an in browser photo editor that allows you to do some basic photoshop functions as well as</p>
<p>apply some simple filters. I built this as a project to gain a better understanding of image manipulation and working with</p>
<p>the HTML5 canvas element. It takes avantage of Facebook Oauth so the user can edit a photo and then post that photo</p>
<p>directly to their wall.</p>
