<h1>Projects:</h1>

<h3>Photogrammatron</h3> 
<p>Photogrammatron is an in browser photo editor that allows you to do some basic photoshop functions as well as</p>
<p>apply some simple filters. I built this as a project to gain a better understanding of image manipulation and working with</p>
<p>the HTML5 canvas element. It takes avantage of Facebook Oauth and the Facebook API so the user can edit a photo and then</p>
<p>post that photo directly to their wall.</p>

<p>and a mySQL database. It features handrolled CSRF protection and other security protocols to help keep the user protected.</p>
